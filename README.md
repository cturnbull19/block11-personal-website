# block10-personal-website
This website is the personal website of a fictional character I made up. I wanted to feel more creative, so instead of doing just myself i pretended that I was a princess. 

To start setting everything up, I created my three HTML pages. I used the same header for all three of my sites to keep that looking consistent. To complete the header, I used the CSS styling of Grid. This was incredibly difficult for me to do on Wednesday and it looked pretty dreadful and I didn't understand. On Thursday, we had a review of this styling element and it all clicked! So i went through and deleted all of my CSS from the day before because it was trash. Once I figured out the whys behind Grid, it then all came together pretty quicly. I then went through and set up the structure of my pages within the main element through sections and divs. 

Home Page:
The home page was just a general introduction page. I threw in a photo which i floated right and gave an absolute position so that as the page got smaller the picture stayed in view. The biggest thing that I did with the rest of my page was setting widths for each of my divs so that there wouldn't be any overlapping with the image. I also created a form at the bottom of my page to "get in contact" with princess Caroline. that was pretty simple for me

About Me Page:
The about me page was almost pretty straightforward, but I wanted to add an aside element and have links on the side of my page. and I wanted those to follow the viewer up and down the page. I used the sticky position, as i learned from MDN. I then floated that to the right as well and set up padding and widths for the aside element and there we were! I was pretty pleased with the result!

I then googled "soft colors" because I get sensory overload (as Megan says, I'm a neuro spicy) and i like when pages have nice soft colors. I felt that soft colors also went along with my princess vibes. 

The last thing i did was set up my JavaScript. At first I tried to get my JS to interact with my Submit form button, but as i was watching tutorials and looking on MDN i realized there were many elements within those that i just did not understand and I didn't want to just copy the code without understanding the why behind it. SO instead I just set up my JS to pop up with a message upon opening my home page!
